# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

This project aims to identify and predict the satisfaction level of airline passengers using machine learning techniques. It is inspired by and based on the structure of [MOstrowka's reference notebook](https://github.com/MOstrowka/AirlinePassengers).

## Problem Statement

Airlines collect vast amounts of customer feedback, but lack automated tools to process and analyze these reviews effectively. This project builds a predictive model to determine whether a passenger is satisfied based on various service factors like seat comfort, inflight service, and boarding experience.
